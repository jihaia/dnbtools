You must immediately notify Unfuddle of any unauthorized uses of Your Content, Your account or any other breaches of security.
Responsibility of Participants. If You participate in an account on the Website, You are responsible for the Content of that account and any harm resulting from that Content, regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, source code, graphics, an audio/visual file or computer software. By making Content available, You represent and warrant that:
the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;

the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
the Content is not spam, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing); and
the Content is not obscene or libelous, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party.
For purposes of these Terms of Use (including this Section 2), to "participate in an account" means to create Content, to access Content, to read or display any portion of Content, to comment on Content, to post any material (including links) to Content or, to use in any other way the Website in connection with Content.

Responsibility of Website Visitors. Each visitor to the Website is solely responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect him(her)self and his (her) computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Unfuddle has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including source code and computer software, posted to the Website, and therefore cannot be responsible for that material's content, use or effects. By operating the Website, Unfuddle does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful.
Payment for Services. Except for any "free" account which Unfuddle may, in its sole discretion choose to offer or not offer under any terms it deems appropriate, all Unfuddle accounts are available for use and can be accessed if and only if payment is received. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Unfuddle, billing will be on a monthly basis and charged to the credit card furnished for that purpose. The actual amount billed will be based on the Unfuddle plan originally selected by the customer; provided, however, that if the level of Unfuddle use (i.e., the number of workspaces, pages, projects, participants or the amount of disk space used) exceeds the limits of the original plan, then the billing may be adjusted as necessary to cover the higher increased use. Unfuddle will also charge You for any sales, use or other taxes applicable to the Services. Unfuddle may change the schedule of fees or the Terms of Use from time to time. Unfuddle will post the revised fees and/or Terms of Use on the Website. If a fee increase or change to the Terms of Use is not acceptable, You may cancel the Services as provided herein. Continuing to use the Services constitutes Your agreement to all changes.
Unlimited Storage. In some cases, Unfuddle may offer accounts with "unlimited" storage. If Your account storage significantly exceeds the average storage of other Unfuddle customers (as determined solely by Unfuddle), or the size of individual items stored in Your account significantly exceeds the size of individual items of other Unfuddle customers (as determined solely by Unfuddle), Unfuddle reserves the right to immediately disable or terminate Your account, at its sole discretion.
Termination of Account. Either You or Unfuddle may terminate Your Unfuddle account at any time, for any reason or no reason, by giving notice in accordance with the information then on the Website. No refunds will be made for sums previously paid — regardless of the timing of the termination. All account terminations are immediate. You are solely responsible to download, copy or otherwise preserve Your Content stored on the Website before terminating Your Unfuddle account. The reasons why Unfuddle may, in its sole discretion, terminate Your Unfuddle account include, without limitation: (1) You fail to provide and update credit card or other payment method information that enables Unfuddle to collect fees; (2) any information You give us is false, misleading or incomplete; or (3) Your account has been inactive for more than 180 days; or (4) You engage in conduct which, in our judgment, interferes with the operation or use of the Services.
